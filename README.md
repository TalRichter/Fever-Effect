  <strong>Fever Effect in ASD</strong><br/>
  Machine learning pipeline for predicting fever-related behavioral responses in autism using transcriptomic and clinical data.

## 🧬 Overview

This repository contains the full pipeline used in our study of the **Fever Effect in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** — a phenomenon where some autistic individuals show temporary behavioral improvements during febrile episodes.

We integrated:
- **Transcriptomic data** (RNA-seq),
- **Genomic data** (WES), and
- **Rich clinical metadata**

from the **Simons Simplex Collection (SSC)** to uncover molecular signatures and predictive markers associated with this effect.

## 🔍 Highlights

- ⚙️ **Interpretable ML Pipeline**  
  Built an XGBoost classifier to predict fever-associated subgroups, with:
  - Bootstrap-based downsampling for imbalanced data
  - SHAP for model interpretation
  - Feature selection and performance tracking

- 🧪 **Differential Expression Analysis**  
  Used DESeq2 and edgeR-limma to identify genes linked to fever response.

- 🔎 **Pathway-Based Outlier Detection**  
  Detected immune-related transcriptomic outliers using Mahalanobis distance.

- 🔄 **Subgroup Discovery**  
  Applied spectral biclustering to identify ASD subtypes based on expression profiles.
